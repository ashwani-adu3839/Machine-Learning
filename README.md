Classification and regression Deep learning codes in TensorFlow API

We have constucted different sets of datasets for classification:
1) Blobs
2) Concentric Circles
3) Half Moon
4) Spiral

These datasets have been classified using dense network of the tensorflow API. We then used mlxtend library to generate the boundaries for different classifcation class.
